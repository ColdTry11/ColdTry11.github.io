      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello, my name is Kris Kyle Kekoa Montemayor, and I am an aspiring game developer. Video games have always been
        a passion of mine, and as I grew up, I became increasingly fascinated with the inner workings of computers. I
        pursued this interest by taking computer classes in high school, where I learned how to code. It was then that I
        realized I could use this newfound skill to bring my own game ideas to life. Then I continued by majoring in Computer Science when I got into College.</p>
      <p>Since then, I have been dedicated to improving my skills as a developer, with the ultimate goal of creating
        engaging and immersive video game experiences. It's not always easy, but I am committed to working hard and
        continually learning to achieve my dreams. I can't wait to see what the future holds for me in the world of game
        development.</p>

        <h3>Battleship War</h3>
        <p>This project was a game-changer for me when it comes to programming. It really helped me level up my object-oriented programming skills by teaching me how to use classes, objects, methods, and attributes. This was a huge project, and it allowed me to dive deep into the principles of programming and apply them in a practical way. I also got to explore some key concepts like encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism, which helped me create stronger and more effective code. I learned that good programming isn't just about getting the technical details right, but also about designing software that's efficient, elegant, and easy to use. </p>
